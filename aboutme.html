                    <p>Hi,my name is David Shepherd and I am a Senior at Bridgewater State University studying Computer Science.
                        I hope once I graduate that I can land a job in Cyber Security but I am open to other jobs as well.

                    </p>

                  <div class="col-lg-6" style="background-color:teal;">
                    <p>Some things I enjoy to do are sports, gaming, and going to the beach.
                        For sports I play baseball and basketball.
                        For gaming I stream occassionally on the platform twitch where I have an affilliate partnership but I usually just do it for fun.
                        I live in a town that has 5 beaches so they are very acessible, I really enjoy spending summer days lounging.
                    </p>
